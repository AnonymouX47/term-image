    Args:
        more: A callable, which when passed the input received so far, as a `bytearray`
          object, returns a boolean. If it returns:

          * ``True``, more input is waited for.
          * ``False``, the input received so far is returned immediately.

        timeout: Time limit for awaiting input, in seconds.
        min: Causes to block until at least the given number of bytes have been read.
        echo: If ``True``, any input while waiting is printed unto the screen.
          Any input before or after calling this function is not affected.

    Returns:
        The input read (empty, if *min* == ``0`` (default) and no input is received
        before *timeout* is up) or ``None`` if not supported.

    If *timeout* is ``None`` (default), all available input is read without blocking.

    If *timeout* is not ``None`` and:

      * *timeout* < ``0``, it's infinite.
      * *min* > ``0``, input is waited for until at least *min* bytes have been read.

        After *min* bytes have been read, the following points apply with *timeout*
        being the leftover of the original *timeout*, if not yet used up.

      * *more* is not given, input is read or waited for until *timeout* is up.
      * *more* is given, input is read or waited for until ``more(input)`` returns
        ``False`` or *timeout* is up.

    Upon return or interruption, the :term:`active terminal` is **immediately** restored
    to the state in which it was met.
