   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to Term-Image's documentation!
======================================

.. attention::
   ðŸš§ Under Construction - There might be incompatible changes between minor
   versions of `version zero <https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html#spec-item-4>`_!

   If you want to use this library in a project while it's still on version zero,
   ensure you pin the dependency to a specific minor version e.g ``>=0.4,<0.5``.

   On this note, you probably also want to switch to the specific documentation for the
   version you're using (somewhere at the lower left corner of this page).
