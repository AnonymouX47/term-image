.. attention::
   ðŸš§ Under Construction - There might be incompatible changes between minor versions of
   `version zero <https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html#spec-item-4>`_!

   If you want to use ``term-image`` in a project while it's still on version zero,
   ensure you pin the dependency to a specific minor version e.g ``>=0.4,<0.5``.
