.. note::
   If you've tested ``term-image`` on any other terminal emulator that meets all
   requirements, please mention the name in a new thread under `this discussion
   <https://github.com/AnonymouX47/term-image/discussions/4>`_.

   Also, if you're having an issue with terminal support, you may report or check
   information about it in the discussion linked above.

.. note::
   Some terminal emulators support 24-bit color escape sequences but have a
   256-color pallete. This will limit color reproduction.
