Image viewer
============

.. attention::
   ðŸš§ Under Construction - There might be incompatible changes (particularly in the CLI
   options and configuration) between minor versions of
   `version zero <https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html#spec-item-4>`_!

   If you want to use the viewer in a project while it's still on version zero,
   ensure you pin the dependency to a specific minor version e.g ``>=0.4,<0.5``.

   On this note, you probably also want to switch to the specific documentation for the
   version you're using (somewhere at the lower left corner of this page).

   tui
   config

The package comes with a standalone in-terminal image viewer based on the library.

| The image viewer is started from the command line using either the ``term-image`` command (only works if the Python scripts directory is on ``PATH``) or ``python -m term_image``.
| **\*Take note of the differences**.


Image sources
-------------

The viewer accepts the following kinds of sources:

* An image file on a local filesystem.
* A directory on a local filesystem.
* An Image URL.

Any other thing given as a :term:`source` is simply reported as invalid.


Modes
-----

The viewer can be used in two modes:

1. **CLI mode**

   In this mode, images are directly printed to standard output. It is used when:
   
   * output is not a terminal
   * there is only a single image source
   * the ``--cli`` option is specified

2. **TUI mode**

   In this mode, a Terminal/Text-based User Interface is launched, within which images
   and directories can be browsed and viewed in different ways. It is used when:

   * there is at least one non-empty directory source
   * there are multiple image sources
   * the ``--tui`` option is specified


Usage
-----

| Run ``term-image`` with the ``--help`` option to see the usage info and help text.
| All arguments and options are described there.

Note that some options are only applicable to a specific mode. If used with the other mode, they're simply ignored.

| Some options have a ``[N]`` (where *N* is a number) behind their description, it indicates that the option has a footnote attached.
| All footnotes are at the bottom of the help text.


.. _render-styles-viewer:

Render Styles
-------------

See :ref:`render-styles`.

By default, the best style supported by the :term:`active terminal` is automatically detected.
A particular render style can be specified using the ``style`` :ref:`config option <style-config>`
or the ``-S | --style`` command-line option.

| If the specified render style is graphics-based and not supported, an error notification is emitted and the process exits with code ``1`` (FAILURE, see the description below).
| If the specified render style is text-based and not [fully] supported, a warning notification is emitted but execution still proceeds with the style.

The ``--force-style`` command-line option can be used to bypass style support checks and force the usage of any style whether it's supported or not.


.. _font-ratio-viewer:

Font Ratio
----------

The :term:`font ratio` is taken into consideration when setting image sizes for **text-based** render styles, in order to preserve the aspect ratio of images drawn to the terminal.

| This value is determined by the :ref:`config option <font-ratio-config>` ``font ratio`` OR either of the command-line options ``-F | --font-ratio`` and ``--auto-font-ratio``.
| The command-line options are mutually exclusive and override the config option.

| By default (i.e without changing the config option value or specifying the command-line option), ``term-image`` tries to determine the value from the :term:`active terminal` which works on most mordern terminal emulators (currently supported on UNIX-like platforms only).
| This is probably the best choice, except the terminal emulator or platform doesn't support this feature.

| If ``term-image`` is unable to determine this value automatically, it falls back to ``0.5``, which is a reasonable value in most cases.
| In case *auto* font ratio is not supported and the fallback value does not give expected results, a different value can be specified using the config or command-line option.

.. attention::
   If using *auto* font ratio and the :term:`active terminal` is not the controlling terminal of the ``term-image`` process (e.g output is redirected to another terminal), ensure no process that might read input (e.g a shell) is currently running in the active terminal, as such a process might interfere with determining the font ratio on some terminal emulators (e.g VTE-based ones).

   For instance, the ``sleep`` command can be executed if a shell is currently running in the active terminal.


Notifications
-------------

| Notifications are event reports meant to be brought to the immediate knowledge of the user.
| Notifications have two possible destinations:

* Standard output/error stream: This is used while the TUI is **not** launched.
* TUI :ref:`notification bar <notif-bar>`: This is used while the TUI is launched.

Notifications sent to the TUI's :ref:`notification bar <notif-bar>` automatically disappear after 5 seconds.

.. _logging:

Logging
-------

Logs are more detailed event reports meant for troubleshooting and debugging purporses.

Logs are written to a file on a local filesystem. The default log file is ``~/.term_image/term_image.log`` but a different file can be specified:

* for all sessions, using the :ref:`log file <log-file>` config option
* per session, using the ``--log`` command-line option

A log entry has the following format:

.. code-block:: none

   (<pid>) (<date> <time>) <process>: <thread>: [<level>] <module>: <function>: <message>

* *pid*: The process ID of the term-image session.
* *date* and *time*: Current system date and time in the format ``%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S,<ms>``, where ``<ms>`` is in milliseconds.
* *process* and *thread*: The names of the python process and thread that produced the log record.

  * Only present when the *logging level* is set to ``DEBUG`` (either by ``--debug`` or ``--log-level=DEBUG``).

* *level*: The level of the log entry, this indicates it's importance.
* *module*: The package sub-module from which it originated.
* *function*: The function from which it originated.

  * Only present when running on **Python 3.8+** and *logging level* is set to ``DEBUG`` (either by ``--debug`` or ``--log-level=DEBUG``).

* *message*: The actual report describing the event that occured.


.. note::

   * Certain logs and some extra info are only provided when *logging level* is set to ``DEBUG``.
   * Log files are **appended to**, so it's safe use the same file for multiple sessions.
   * Log files are rotated upon reaching a size of **1MiB**.

     * Only the current and immediate previous log file are kept.

   * The Process ID of the ``term-image`` instance preceeds every log entry, so this can be used to distinguish and track logs from different sessions running simultaneously while using the same log file.


Exit Codes
----------
``term-image`` returns the following exit codes with the specified meanings:

* ``0`` (SUCESS): Exited normally and successfully.
* ``1`` (FAILURE): Exited due to an unhandled exception or a non-specific error.
* ``2`` (INVALID_ARG): Exited due to an invalid command-line argument value or option combination.
* ``3`` (INTERRUPTED): The program recieved an interrupt signal i.e ``SIGINT``.
* ``4`` (CONFIG_ERROR): Exited due to an irremediable error while loading the user config.
* ``5`` (NO_VALID_SOURCE): Exited due to lack of any valid source.


Known Issues
------------
1. The TUI is not supported on Windows
2. Drawing of images and animations doesn't work completely well with Python for windows
   (tested in Windows Terminal and MinTTY). See :ref:`here <library-issues>` for details.

   In the viewer's CLI mode, use the ``--h-allow`` option to specify a horizontal allowance.

3. Some animations with the **kitty** render style within the **Kitty terminal emulator**
   might be glitchy at the moment. See :ref:`here <library-issues>` for details.


Planned Features
----------------
In no particular order:

* Performance improvements

* Open image in external viewer
* Pattern-based file and directory exclusion
* Minimum and maximum file size
* Optionally following/skipping symlinks
